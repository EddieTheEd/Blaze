This folder is for assets used **universally** thoughout themes. For example, if multiple themes use the same font, you can put these fonts in a folder here. Note that you may need to link to assets in this folder differently (maybe maybe not). For example, if you want to reference a javascript file with the path `blaze/universal/amongus.js`, **from a file in the root directory**(i.e. `content/coolfile.md`) you should link the script as `<script src="./amongus.js"></script>`.
