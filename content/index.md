## Hi!

Blaze is a project that aims to convert a collection of Markdown files, specifically in the format preferred by [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), into a static website.

Worked on by Ed and Ossac (maybe mace if he responds to my emails).

Officially releasing soon. See the [repository](https://github.com/EddieTheEd/Blaze) to find out on our progress!

[so what can this "blaze" thing do?](showcase)
