hello

.md

but also

.md)
- Is this how it is supposed to work? - T

but [this link](index.md) is processed correctly...

Great, so .md is not going to be processed if its in plain text, but will be processed in the link.

The only way I see this going wrong is if you are talking about .md files, then you put a bracket around .md, which would be weird, but that's an issue for another time.
