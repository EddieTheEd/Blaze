title: Building Blaze
description: How to locally serve Blaze.

## Important note!

Currently, this should in theory only work **Unix/macOS**, as Blaze uses cargo.

If you want to use this using Windows, you will probably have to install cargo conventionally, i.e. search it, and also install make. Once that is done, you can run make serve.

## Prerequisites

- Make
- npm
- cargo(from rustup)

## How to!

- Go to the root directory of the repository. i.e. /home/eddietheed/Blaze/
- Execute `make help`(or just `make`)
- Follow the instructions
- Tada!
