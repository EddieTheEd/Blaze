## Buggies

These are the current bugs that Blaze has:

- Backlinks do not work when the filename of the thing being linked has spaces in it
- ~Title frontmatter formatted like `title: "{{title}}"` will still have the quotation marks~
    - FIXED - Reaper

## The development plan

The plan will be divided into these parts:

### Spring Cleaning

*Polishing and reorganising the code so future work is easier*

- Remove unnecessary parts of CSS
- Create separate .js files for partials
- Properly load js scripts

### Crucial Elements

*These are the things needed for basic function. The benchmark for this is whether my obsidian vault works with as expected.*

- ~~draft: true excluding files~~
- backlinks fixed
- Switch from Prism to [Rehype Pretty Code](https://rehype-pretty-code.netlify.app/) (thanks Jzhao)

### Awesome Features

*Really cool features that I want Blaze to have*

- Full text search
- Themes
- Analytics
    - This is a maybe. I dunno, I never felt that analytics were important
- Minification
    - Have js and css minified

### Customisation

*Making it usable for the user*

- Make it fully customisable from blazeconfig.toml
    - Conditional logic in the html partials

### Optimisiation

*Focusing on performance*

- Only modify files that are changed, i.e. don't delete all the html and replace, but change the html for files that are changed (wording???)
    - Maybe check last date/time of modification? and store last cargo run/build date/time?
