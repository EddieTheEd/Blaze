Say you want to keep the source code to your website private. Maybe you want more control over the content, maybe you made some modifications to the code that you want to be kept private. Don't worry, Blaze can work with private repos!

Not to toot my own horn, but my personal website ([ed.toomwn.xyz](https://ed.toomwn.xyz/)) uses a private repo.

As you can probably guess, the way I did it(and the way I suggest to do it) is to use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
