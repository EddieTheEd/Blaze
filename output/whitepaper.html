<h2>TLDR</h2>
<p><strong>Blaze</strong> is a <em>Markdown</em> parser / static site generator written in <em>Rust</em> that creates a static site, to be used however you like! (hopefully nothing illegal).</p>
<h2>Preface</h2>
<h3>Definitions</h3>
<p><strong>Blaze</strong> $\implies$ The <a href="https://github.com/EddieTheEd/Blaze">project</a> for which this whitepaper refers to, a Markdown parser written in Rust to make websites &quot;blazingly fast&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>User</strong> $\implies$ The individual who uses the source code for Blaze</p>
<h3>Contributions</h3>
<p>This project was made by <a href="https://github.com/EddieTheEd">Ed</a>, with massive help <del>he wrote literally 99.99999% of the rust code</del> from <a href="https://github.com/notmario">Ossac</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Grim4Reaper">Tag</a> is a &quot;collaborator&quot;, but he hasn't done anything. :/</p>
<h3>Inspiration</h3>
<p>Blaze's links graph(to be added) is heavily inspired by the <a href="https://jzhao.xyz/">Jzhao's</a> work on <a href="https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz">Quartz</a>, which runs on <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>.</p>
<p>I made Blaze because I wanted to essentially make my own version of Quartz, initially intended to be written in <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, but thanks to Ossac it is instead made from <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>.</p>
<p>The idea for sidenotes (to be added) is inspired from <a href="https://www.daveliepmann.com/">Dave Liepmann's</a> work on <a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/">Tufte-CSS</a>, which itself stems from the &quot;distinctive style&quot; of the &quot;revolutionary retina of our time&quot;, <a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/">Edward Tufte</a>.</p>
<h2>Reasoning</h2>
<p>Blaze is built under the following principles:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Knowledge should be free and widely accessible.</strong>
<ul>
<li>What this means is that Blaze does not include ways to add paywalls on the resultant websites it makes.</li>
<li>If someone wants to do that, by all means they can, but that is not what Blaze was designed for.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge should be presented however the user likes.</strong>
<ul>
<li>There's no one style of a website that fits everyone's taste. That's why Blaze offers a &quot;whopping&quot;(2) range of different &quot;themes&quot; for the website, including a minimalist theme.</li>
<li>However, most work goes into the default theme.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge should be expressed in an <em>expressive</em> <del>and vibrant</del> format.</strong>
<ul>
<li>This makes it more engaging and more effectively learnt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge that crosses the line between informative and personal should be hidden at the discretion of the user.</strong>
<ul>
<li>While knowledge should be free, users should not feel forced to liberate their personal information into the wild.</li>
<li>This can include, and not be limited to, their <em>actual</em> personal details (address, name, credit card number(but seriously if you are gonna do that you're a little goofy)) or works that the user deems personal by their own standards.</li>
<li>Blaze is not trying to impart any standards on the user, and simply hands them the tool to make the choice for themselves.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Roadmap</h2>
<h3>2023-07-26</h3>
<ul>
<li>White paper made</li>
</ul>
<h3>2023-08-18</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/EddieTheEd/Blaze/stargazers">Starred by Jzhao</a>!!!!!!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Plans</h2>
<h3>Essential</h3>
<ul>
<li><del>Functional TOC</del>
<ul>
<li>Have the TOC work for more than just h2 and h3. All I need to do is just modify the logic. Should be pretty simple. But I've been putting it off. I think the best way to approach it is to create a file that essentially tests the TOC. From there, I can look at the problem from a better perspective and see how the logic is going to work. This has surprisingly become a rather interesting question with regards to comp sci in general.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><del>Actually add the graph</del></li>
<li><del>Actually add the sidenotes</del></li>
<li><strong>Frontmatterification</strong>
<ul>
<li><del>Fix current bugs</del></li>
<li><del>Description displayed below title</del></li>
<li>CSS changes via frontmatter</li>
<li><del>draft: true prevents the page from being made</del></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><del>Fix formatting for callouts to align with the standard</del></li>
<li>Make repository into display of all features, breaking down code
<ul>
<li>Much like how <a href="https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/">Quartz</a> does it.</li>
<li>Shouldn't be too technical, someone like me at the start of this whole thing should be able to understand and learn from it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Extreme Customisability using blazeconfig.toml</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Able to use or not use things like Mathjax directly from blazeconfig.toml</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Less important</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Spruce up Backlinks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multi-device layouts</p>
<ul>
<li>Should be a simple fix with css. Nothing too hard I hope.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Graph full screen mode(like how Quartz does it, looks very hot 👍)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>x min read on top (literally stolen from Quartz)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Distant</h3>
<ul>
<li>Full-text search
<ul>
<li>Optional natural language search??!?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>More themes! <a href="https://nottacoz.github.io/jacaranda/"><del>Jacaranda</del> Dracula</a> theme potentially?</li>
<li><del>Light dark mode</del> never, dark mode is superior
<ul>
<li>Just kidding. But I think I'll implement it differently to how Quartz does it. Instead of just a light and dark mode button, I think I might instead have a &quot;settings&quot; button, where the user can make personalisations to the way they view the Blaze website, stored locally of course.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Search for pathing
<ul>
<li>Breadth-first search :(</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SPA???
<ul>
<li>Maybe. I have bad memories with SPA from Quartz :( but it makes things faster, and I should be able to implement this alongside with changes to the frontmatter.</li>
<li>i.e. If the theme of a page is &quot;dracula&quot;, for example, this should still be loaded regardless of whether Blaze is configered to be a SPA or not.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<h3>Donating</h3>
<p>Uhh this is a weird topic, which is why I put it in miscellaneous. So, Github has a sponsoring thing, for example you can sponsor <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/jackyzha0">Jacky Zhao, creator of Quartz</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/aidenybai">Aiden Bai, creator of Million.js(awesome)</a>. Now. And I <em>really</em> want to emphasis this.</p>
<p><strong>You do not need to donate anything! For the foreseeable future, all code I work on as a hobby will be free and open source.</strong></p>
<p>In fact, if there's anyone you should sponsor, its <a href="https://github.com/notmario">Ossac</a>, who's hard carrying this whole project.</p>
<p>But if you do donate to me, umm thanks I guess? Just know all the money will go towards buying <a href="https://www.spafoods.com.sg/products/blue-pea-flower-tea-with-manuka-honey">this exact brand of blue pea tea</a>.</p>
<h3>Why not use Quartz?</h3>
<p>You should use Quartz. It's definitely way more well-made, polished and has a great, supportive community. The goal of Blaze is not to surpass or even come close to the quality of Quartz, but instead to be a personal passion project made open source so others can use it. Yeah. Enjoy :)</p>
<h3>Can I be a contributor?</h3>
<p>Absolutely! If you have something cool to add to the project, just make a pull request. If it works on your machine, it should work on mine and Ossac's as well.</p>
<h3>Can I use the code under a non-free(proprietary) license?</h3>
<p>Blaze is actually licensed under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unlicense">Unlicense</a><sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>, as shown in the <a href="https://github.com/EddieTheEd/Blaze/blob/main/LICENSE">repository file</a>. Although I don't suggest you should do something like redistributing the code under a proprietary or commercial license, I don't really have much a say in it. I mean, why on earth would you do such a thing for this kind of project anyways?</p>
<p>Anyways, go ham I guess?</p>
<h3>Can I suggest ideas?</h3>
<p>Absolutely! Email me at <a href="mailto:ed@toomwn.xyz">ed@toomwn.xyz</a>, or dm me on Discord, my username is &quot;definitelyeddie.&quot;.</p>
<p>Ideas are welcome, but please do not spam my Discord or email, and I (or Ossac) don't have to implement any ideas suggested.</p>
